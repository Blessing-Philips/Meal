               <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <table border="10">
    <tr>
        <th>Rice</th>
        <td>Thinly slice 1/2 large red onion. Place 4 cups long-grain white rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse thoroughly under cool running water. Set aside to drain.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Vegetable oil, Kosher salt, Curry powder, Fresh thyme sprigs,  Bay leaves and Tomato pasta</th>
        <td>Heat 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons tomato paste, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 2 teaspoons curry powder, 4 fresh thyme sprigs or 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 1 teaspoon ground white pepper, and 2 bay leaves. Stir and cook until the paste has darkened in color, 2 to 3 minutes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Red pepper</th>
        <td>Pour in the red pepper base and 3 cups stock. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
         <th>Water</th>
         <td>Add the rice and stir until combined. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with aluminum foil and then the lid. Cook undisturbed for 30 minutes.
Remove the lid and foil and gently fluff the rice. Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. If the rice tastes a bit undercooked, remove from the heat, cover again, and let sit for 10 minutes. Donâ€™t worry if the rice burns a bit at the bottom of the pot. This is part of what contributes a smoky flavor to the dish, and some people actually prefer this part! Taste and season the rice with more kosher salt as needed.</td>
